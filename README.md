# Abstract

Visual-textual few-shot learning (VT-FSL) models have recently shown great potential in cross-domain hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, as textual descriptions provide domain-invariant semantic knowledge that enhances visual generalization. However, existing VT-FSL methods typically perform global image-label alignment using simple class names or short label phrases, capturing only coarse-grained semantics and lacking explicit conceptual cues aligned with visual spatial-spectral features. Consequently, the resulting visual-textual correspondence remains sensitive to domain shifts. To address this issue, we argue that concept-level semantics such as color, material or density are more stable and transferable across domains. Therefore, we propose a novel concept-guided visual-textual few-shot learning (CGVT-FSL) framework. First, we design a concept-embedded class-label text description (C2TD) method that incorporates LLM-generated concept knowledge into class-level textual representations, enabling interpretable and transferable semantic alignment. Second, we develop a visual-textual dual-branch transformer (VTDFormer), which jointly extracts visual and textual spatial-spectral features across domains. Moreover, a spatial-spectral-textual domain adversarial module (SSTDAM) is introduced to further mitigate domain shift by leveraging the shared concept-embedded linguistic domain. Extensive experiments on six HSI datasets demonstrate that CGVT-FSL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSL methods.
